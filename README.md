Here you can choose:
- the chat export type
- which year should be used for data extraction
- which graphs should be plotted
- the chat export file itself
- colours for different graph types
- graph file name

Only the export file itself needs to be specified, along with the year. You can leave all the remaining settings as they are.

## 4. Press start and enjoy!

After pressing the start button, the program will automatically create a folder called plots in which, it will store your graphs.

Enjoy the fun with visualizing your chats and be sure to share them with your friends. üòÅ

## If you are interested in contributing, running from source or building it yourself
